        <section>What is agile?</section>
        <section>Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that
          helps teams deliver value to customers faster and with less hassle</section>
        <section>Agile methodology appeared in 2001 when the Manifesto was published. Agile.
        </section>
      </section>

        </section>
        <section>
          <ul style="font-size: 26px;">
            <li>The highest priority for us is to meet the needs
              customer, thanks to the regular and early delivery of valuable software
              security.</li>
            <li>Changing requirements is welcome, even late in development.
              Agile processes allow you to use change to provide the customer
              competitive advantage.</li>
            <li>A working product should be released as often as possible, with a frequency
              from a couple of weeks to a couple of months.</li>
            <li>Throughout the project, developers and business representatives should
              work together daily.
            </li>
            <li>Motivated professionals should work on the project. To
              work has been done, create conditions, provide support and fully
              trust them.</li>
            <li>Direct communication is the most practical and effective
              a way to share information both with the team itself and within the team.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

            <li>Investors, developers and users should be able to
              maintain a constant rhythm indefinitely. Agile helps to establish such
              sustainable development process.</li>
            <li>Constant attention to technical excellence and quality
              design increases project flexibility.</li>
            <li>Simplicity - the art of minimizing unnecessary work - is essential.</li>
            <li>The best requirements, architectural and technical solutions are born
              in self-organizing teams.</li>
            <li></li>The team should systematically analyze possible ways efficiency improvements and adjust accordingly
            style
